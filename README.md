# Small Programs

I am from an Engineering background and I am learning to use github to post my programming progress as I learn new things in Python Programming and I make new projects.

My interests are web development for use in Data Science projects since I really love Data and mathematics. I wish to become very proficient in Django so as to implement large scale projects in Data.
